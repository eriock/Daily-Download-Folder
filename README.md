Key Features:
Automatically organizes downloads into folders named by the date (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
Prevents clutter by ensuring all files from the same day are stored together.
Ensures unique file names using Chrome’s conflict resolution ("uniquify") to avoid overwriting files.

How it works:
The extension listens for download events and renames the file’s destination path based on the current date. If the folder for that day does not exist, it is created automatically.

Installation Steps:
1. Go to chrome://extensions in your Chrome browser.
2. Turn on Developer mode by clicking the toggle in the top right corner of the screen.
3. Click Load Unpacked and navigate to the folder where the background.js, manifest.json, and popup.html files are located.
4. Select the folder and the extension will be loaded.
5. Turn on the extension, and you're ready to go!

Perfect For:
Users who frequently download files and want them organized by date.
Anyone looking to streamline file management without manual folder creation.
